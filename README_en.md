## Thanks

The reason for writing such a tool is because I saw a FIGlet tool on the web page, so I’m thinking,
I can also make such a similar tool and make it easy to use. 

Some fonts integrated in this tool are also copied from FIGlet, it is modified to generate the font used in the tool.
So thanks a lot to the FIGlet, especially his author.
